<h4>Spend summertime by the water in D.C.</h4>

<p1>Just a 15 minute bus ride from Georgetown, you can spend a host summer day by the water. Rent either a rowboat, kayak or bycicle and spend your day by the water.
There is a nice lawn where you can grill or just enjoy the sun. This place is called Fletcher's Cove. A place i truly recommend on a hot summer day!</p1>
