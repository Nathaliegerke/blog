<h4>Dinner in Prauge? This is where you should go.</h4>

If you ever want to experience a city with both beautiful culture but most of all, amazing food, Prauge is the place to be. Here you can go to beer museums, visit bars with over 150 different typer of beer, see the John Lennon graffiti wall, see the castle, go paddling in the river or have a dinner that you will never forget. The town is not that big so you can walk almost everywhere and there are many different types of restaurants, but the question you need to know the answer of before you arrive, is where you should go? If you are looking for a fine dining, but money worth spending, listen closely. 

If you up for a nice steak, George Primesteak is the place to visit. They are the only restaurant in the entire Chez-Republic that are allowed by the governement to import meet from the United States. Meet with outstanding high quality. Before you decide what kind of meet you want, they will show you all the meet they have for the day. Then they will serve your meet perfectly cooked. Both the food and the high standard of service makes this restaurant outstanding!
