title: Asian fusion in Prauge

---

<p1>My favorite all time food is asian fusion. Where ever i go, i want to try some asian fusion restaurants. 
One of my favorite is in Prauge called SaSaZu. It's very hidden and hard to find if you don't take a cab. 
The food, service, interior and drinks was outstanding! I have friends who just fly here for the day, from Sweden, to eat there food.
I truly recommend this place!</p1>
