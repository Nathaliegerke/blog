Title: My favorite bar in the entire world

<h4>Hemingway Bar, you took me by a storm</h4>

<p>I love trying out different bars when i travel. When i was in Prauge, i found my favorite one! The name of the bar is Hemingway Bar.
When we came in to the bar, directly someone open the door for us and someone from the staff met us at the door (it's there policy to personaly say hi as soon as someone comes in).
They found a seat for us, because if there isn't a place to sit, they will tell you it's full. Everyone in the bar must have a seat, also one of their polciys.
It was this small, cosy, genuine bar with amazing service! And all the drinks was served in cool, different kinds of glasses. And the taste, yummy! 
I definitely recommend this place if you're ever going to Prauge.</p>
