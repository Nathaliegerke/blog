Title: A beautiful view in D.C.

---

<p>The only reason i found this place is because a waitor told me about it. It's in the old post office in D.C., 
it is in the Trump Hotel. Once there, go around the corner close off Starbucks and there you will see a sign. 
They will tell you where the elevator is which you will take all the way up to the tower. It is free and highly recommended!
