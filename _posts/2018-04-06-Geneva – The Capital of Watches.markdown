title: Geneva â€“ The Capital of Watches

<h4>Visit Watch Heaven</h4>

<p1>If you are into watches, this is the place to go. They have a lot of stores and museums about watches, 
but i recommend to visit the Patek Philippe museum and then the flagship store. The store has been there since the beginning of Patek Philippe, 1839.
At the museum, even if you're not a fan of watches, you will become one. The history of everything is just breath taking! </p1>
