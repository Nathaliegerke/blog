Title: Good Coffee In Washington D.C.

---

<p1>To find good coffee is hard, especially when coffee chains take over the world and focuses more on the brand than it's actual product. In the U.S, Starbucks is a big part of the coffee culture which made it really hard for me to find good coffee here. I moved to Washington D.C. in January of 2018 and i'm a huge coffee lover. In my opinion, i noticed that this is not the case for many american citizens. The just love Starbucks, which according to me is a great brand with bad coffee. But americans seem to love there seasonal coffees with big amounts of both whipped cream and sugar. I'm looking for real coffee! 

I visited a breakfast place here in D.C. (which i will tell you about later), and i found the coffee. I asked our waitor and where the coffee is from, and he told me that there is three coffee shops of that brand. The coffee is called Compass Coffee. I loved the flavour and they didn't drown my cappucino in milk as other places do. So if you're looking for good coffee, this is where you should go. All of their coffee shops is in downtown D.C. </p1>
